Welcome!!

This dataset contains all the files you need to get up and running
with the Hercules cckddump, cckddu64 and cckdload utilities.
Installation consists of 5 step, A, B, C, D and E, and you may start
at any step depending on your environment.
All Object and Load Library files included here were created
on a z/os 2.4 system.

The following files make up this dataset:
--------    ---------------------------------------
$$README    This file

$$RECEIV    Sample Job to Receive the bzip2 and zlib utilities
            and the source code, object and load libraries for
            cckddump, cckddu64 and cckdload

A$BZCOMP    Compile bzip2
A$ZCOMP     Compile zlib

B$PRLK      Pre-link bzip2 and zlib

C$ASM       Assemble CCKDDUMP, CCKDDU64 and CCKDLOAD

D$LKED      Link-edit CCKDDUMP, CCKDDU64 and CCKDLOAD

E$DUMP      Sample CCKDDUMP/CCKDDU64 job stream
E$LOAD      Sample CCKDLOAD job stream

X$BZC       Xmitted bzip2-1.0.6 c source
X$BZH       Xmitted bzip2-1.0.6 h includes
X$BZO       Xmitted bzip2-1.0.6 object files

X$CCKDA     Xmitted cckddump, cckddu64 and cckdload assembler source
X$CCKDO     Xmitted object library for cckddump, cckddu64, cckdload
            and compression utilities (bzip2 and zlib)
X$CCKDL     Xmitted load library containing cckddump, cckddu64
            and cckdload

X$ZC        Xmitted zlib-1.2.11 c source
X$ZH        Xmitted zlib-1.2.11 h includes
X$ZO        Xmitted zlib-1.2.11 object files


Any of the xmitted (X$...) files may be received by issuing the
TSO command `receive inda(cckd.jcl(x$...))', or by using the supplied
RECEIVE JCL

The following graph indicates which files must be received for the
corresponding begining installation step:

If you are not licensed for the os/390 c/c++ compiler then you cannot
begin at step A.  If your release of os/390 is below 2.8, then you
should begin at step A or B or C.  If your release of os/390 is 2.8
or above, then you may proceed step E.  I recommend starting at the
earliest step possible.

Installations steps:

A   Submit job A$BZCOMP and A$ZCOMP to compile the bzip2 and zlib
    compression routines.

B   Submit job B$PRLK to pre-link the bzip2 and zlib compression
    routines

C   Submit job C$ASM to assemble the hi-level assembler programs
    cckddump, cckddu64 and cckdload. Program cckdload requires a HLASM
    release 3 feature. If your HLASM precedes this release level,
    then change the several lines that read
        USING (main+4095,mainend),ra
    to
        USING main+4095,ra
    This, in turn, will cause a return code 4 which can be ignored.
    The return code 4 for cckddump/cckddu64 can likewise be ignored.

D   Submit job D$LKED to linkedit the cckddump, cckddu64 and cckdload
    programs with the compression routines and c library.

E   Modify job E$DUMP to indicate the volume you wish to dump and
    the cckd file you want to create.
    Note that the CCKD.LOAD library needs to be APF authorised.
    Modify job E$LOAD to indicate the offline unit address you want
    to restore to and the cckd file you want to restore from.

Good Luck
