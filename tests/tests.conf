* Configuration file for running tests using "runtest"

# This  file  was  put  into  the  public  domain 2015-10-05 by John P.
# Hartmann.   You  can  use  it  for anything you like, as long as this
# notice remains.

# The current directory should be the build one where the "make"
# command was issued.  Thus, the loadable modules come from the
# newly compiled modules rather than from the installed ones, if any.

# Default module path to avoid taking the standard in /usr/local.  This
# can be overridden by the -p flag

modpath .libs

# The crypto module is not built where the rest of Hercules is built.
# Do not attempt to specify it on the command as a duplicate causes
# Hercules to abort after reading the configuration file.

# To use crypto you must add three symbolic links on UNIX systems (no
# idea what to do on windows):

# ln -s ../crypto/.libs/dyncrypt.so dyncrypt.so
# ln -s ../crypto/.libs/dyncrypt.la dyncrypt.la
# ln -s ../crypto/.libs/dyncrypt.lai dyncrypt.lai

# With these links in place, crypto is loaded automatically at startup
# and any attempt to load it explicitly, either by -l or by ldmod,
# will abort Hercules start.
