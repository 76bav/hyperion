* Configuration file for running tests using "runtest"

# This  file  was  put  into  the  public  domain 2015-10-05 by John P.
# Hartmann.   You  can  use  it  for anything you like, as long as this
# notice remains.

# The current directory should be the build one where the "make"
# command was issued.  Thus, the loadable modules come from the
# newly compiled modules rather than from the installed ones, if any.

# You cannot use the -p flag on the hercules command, as this will
# suppress modpath commands, which in turn will mean that you can do
# crypto or devices, but not both.

# The crypto module is not built where the rest of Hercules is built.
# So we go where it is and load it.
modpath crypto/.libs
ldmod dyncrypt

# And now back to where device managers live
modpath .libs
