ON LOW-LEVEL TEST CASES
=======================

This  directory  contains  test  cases  that are run by Hercules console
commands.

.core
-----

Files  that  have  the  extension  .core  are core images that are to be
loaded by Hercules console command.

.txt
----

Files  that  have  a  txt  extension  must  be  passed  to  Hercules  as
configuration  files.   You  must  eyeball  the console output to ensure
correct  execution.  Test case usually end by loading a disabled PSW; if
that PSW contains 0 as the instruction address, the test case likely ran
without program checks.

.tst
----

Files  that  have  a  tst extension are to be run by the "runtest" shell
script.    They  are  run  and  the  console  output  is  inspected  for
correctness.

Assuming  that  your  are building outside the source tree in the "atom"
directory such that the source is ../hyperion, issue this command to run
and verify the test cases:

   ../hyperion/tests/runtest

This script first creates a composite set of test cases and then invokes
Hercules to run them using the configuration file tests.conf.  This will
make the screen flicker while Hercules runs.  When it completes, the

An early sample output is:

.assemble
---------

Source files for the .tst test cases.  These are assembled on VM and
processed by BLDHTC EXEC.
