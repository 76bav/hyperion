# Hartmann.   You  can  use  it  for anything you like, as long as this
# notice remains.

# This script should be invoked from the top level object directory,
# hyperion if you configured in the source tree; the external object
# directory if you configured elsewhere.

# Having done "make" to build the executable, issue "./hercules" to make
# libtool create an actual executable.

# Arguments:
# 1     Path  from the current directory to the tests source directory.
#       Specify - for the default ../hyperion/tests
# 2     File  name  if  test  case  omitting  the .tst extension or the
#       default * for all .tst files.  But see #4.
# 3     Specify  noexit  to  suppress  the  exit  command that normally
#       terminates  the test cases.  This will allow you to poke around
#       fwith  console commands.  Anything else, including nothing adds
#       an exit command at the end of the composite script.
# 4     File type of test cases.  Default .tst.

# You  can  run  a  specific  test case by "../hyperion/tests/runtest -
# <fname>".  Be sure to omit the extension.

# Tests  are  normally  done alphabetically.  You can use the scripting
# facilities  to  include specific test case files in any order, but do
# not  give these embedded files the default extension (unless you want
# them run twice!).
