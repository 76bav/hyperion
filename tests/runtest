# This  file  was  put  into  the  public  domain 2015-10-05 by John P.
# Hartmann.   You  can  use  it  for anything you like, as long as this
# notice remains.

# Anything  said  in  comments in this file assumes that you have built
# Hercules by git pull; autogen.sh; make.

# This script is in support of "make check".  If run by hand, it should
# be  invoked  from  the  top level object directory, "hyperion" if you
# configured  in  the source tree; the external object directory if you
# configured elsewhere.

# Arguments:

# 1     Path  from the current directory to the tests source directory.
#       Specify - (minus, hyphen) for the default ../hyperion/tests

# 2     File  name  of  test  case  omitting  the .tst extension or the
#       default  '*'  for  all .tst files.  Quote the asterisk to avoid
#       premature file name expansion.  But see #4.

# 3     Specify  noexit  to  suppress  the  exit  command that normally
#       terminates  the test cases.  This will allow you to poke around
#       with  console commands after the test script has run.  Anything
#       else,  including nothing adds an exit command at the end of the
#       composite script.

# 4     File type of test cases.  Default .tst.

# To run a specific test case:
#       ../hyperion/tests/runtest - <fname>
# Again, be sure to omit the extension.

# Tests  are  normally  done alphabetically.  You can use the scripting
# facilities  to  include specific test case files in any order, but do
# not  give these embedded files the default extension (unless you want
# them run twice!).

# We  can  assume  that  the  tests  live in the same directory as this
# script, but you cannot assume that the executable is in the directory
# above.  Read INSTALL in the source directory.

# This  script  must  be  run  from  the object directory, that is, the
# directory  where the "make" command was issued and where the hercules
# libtool  script  is  built.  Or the directory must contain a symbolic
# link to the hercules executable.
