# The Hercules System/370, ESA/390, and z/Architecture Emulator

## The unofficial SoftDevLabs version of Hercules 4.0 (Hyperion)

**Hercules** is an open source software implementation of the mainframe
System/370 and ESA/390 architectures, in addition to the latest 64-bit
z/Architecture. Hercules runs under Linux, Windows,
Solaris, FreeBSD,
and Mac OS X.

Hercules is [OSI Certified Open Source Software](http://www.opensource.org/)
licensed under the terms of the [Q Public Licence](http://fish-git.github.io/html/herclic.html).

This version of Hercules 4.0 Hyperion is my unofficial development version
of the Hercules emulator and contains bleeding edge changes made by myself
to either fix bugs that may still exist in the official version
or other unofficial (unsanctioned) enhancements

Hercules was created by Roger Bowler.
Jay Maynard "the Tron Guy" was the maintainer from 2000 to 2012.
Jan Jaeger designed and implemented many of the advanced features of
Hercules, including dynamic reconfiguration, integrated console,
interpretive execution and z/Architecture support. Until shortly after
the Turbo-Hercules debacle a dedicated crew of programmers was constantly
at work implementing new features and fixing bugs. It is questionable
whether the same is true today.
